Running the Algorithm
After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory where the code is located using the terminal. Then, execute the code using any TypeScript compiler or runtime environment.

Input
The algorithm expects two strings representing numbers (num1 and num2) as input parameters. Ensure that these strings represent valid numbers.

Result
Upon successful execution, the algorithm will return a string representing the multiplication result of the input numbers.

Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is described by O(n^log2 3) ,
where n represents the number of digits in the input numbers.

This complexity indicates the efficiency of the algorithm concerning the size of the input.
